# big_data_analysis
Project Assignments for a Big Data Analysis course at Colorado Technical University. I had 5 projects over the course of 5 weeks, each related to an aspect of big data analysis.

## project1: Parsing Data
This program takes unstructured data and returns key value pairs based on pre-determined patterns, such as patterns for dates, hours, emails and addresses. 

## project2: Sentiment Analyzer
This program looks at tweets about airlines and analyzes the text for themes and sentiments. It uses term-frequency inverse-document-frequency (TF-IDF) to pull out important phrases from each tweet.

## project3: Key Value Pairs
For this assignment, we built a dictionary, listed the keys and values separately, and changed the value of a key. It is a proof of concept program for the fundamentals of how MapReduce analyzes unstructured data.

## project4: Machine Learning
This project trains and tests a machine learning model to predict if a person is injured based on their gait. It uses the k-nearest-neigbors algorithm as a basic machine learning algorithm for predictive analytics. 

## project5: Data Pipeline
In the final project, we built a complete data pipeline to ingest health data, process and store it, and create descriptive analyses to produce value. It is based on population health data in the USA. I focused on visualizing binge drinking prevalence by state and its relatedness to depression, as well as correlating variables to each other with correlation matrices.
